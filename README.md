# MEAN Skeleton

A starting point for development using the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). Watch watches the file system and restarts the server on code change. Livereload automatically reloads the browser when changes are detected (May require live-reload browser add-on). 

## Build & development

- Install dependencies for both client side and server side
```
npm install
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```
- Start server
```
grunt serve
```
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
